<p><b><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u><span>Purpose</span></u></b><b><span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</span></b><span>Members of the American Land Title Association (ALTA) have specific needs, unique to title insurance matters, when asked to insure title to land without exception as to the many matters which might be discoverable from survey and inspection, and which are not evidenced by the public records.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><img alt="American Land Title Association Logo" border="0" height="200" src="https://sites.google.com/site/bandbsurveying/_/rsrc/1353806263778/equipment/altaacsm-land-title-surveys/ALTA-Logo.jpg?height=200&amp;width=136" width="136" /></div>
<p><span>For a survey of real property, and the plat, map or record of such survey, to be acceptable to a title insurance company for the purpose of insuring title to said real property free and clear of survey matters (except those matters disclosed by the survey and indicated on the plat or map), certain specific and pertinent information must be presented for the distinct and clear understanding between the insured, the client (if different from the insured), the title insurance company (insurer), the lender, and the surveyor professionally responsible for the survey.</span></p>
<p><u><span>&nbsp;</span></u></p>
<p><span>In order to meet such needs, clients, insurers, insureds, and lenders are entitled to rely on surveyors to conduct surveys and prepare associated plats or maps that are of a professional quality and appropriately uniform, complete and accurate. To that end, and in the interests of the general public, the surveying profession, title insurers and abstracters, the ALTA and the National Society of Professional Surveyors, Inc. (NSPS) jointly promulgate the within details and criteria setting forth a minimum standard of performance for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys.&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete 2011 ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey includes&nbsp;the on-site fieldwork required under Section 5 herein, the preparation of a plat or map showing the results of the fieldwork and its relationship to record documents as required under Section 6 herein, any information in Table A herein that may have been negotiated with the client, and the certification outlined in Section 7 herein.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>2.</span></b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Request for Survey</u></b>&nbsp;- The client shall request the survey or arrange for the survey to be requested, and shall provide a written authorization to proceed from the person or entity responsible for paying for the survey.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless specifically authorized in writing by the insurer, the insurer shall not be responsible for any costs associated with the preparation of the survey. The request shall specify that an&nbsp;<b>"ALTA/ACSM LAND TITLE SURVEY"</b>&nbsp;is required and which of the optional items listed in Table A herein, if any, are to be incorporated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain properties, including, but not limited to, marinas, campgrounds, trailer parks and leased areas, may present issues outside those normally encountered on an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey. The scope of work related to such properties should be discussed with the client, lender and insurer, and agreed upon in writing prior to requesting the survey. The client may need to secure permission for the surveyor to enter upon the property to be surveyed, adjoining properties, or offsite easements.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><u><span>Surveying Standards and Standards of Care</span></u></b></p>
<p><b><span>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Effective Date&nbsp;</span></b><span>- The 2011 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys are effective February 23, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;As of that date, all previous versions of the Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys are superseded by these standards.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Other Requirements and Standards of Practice</span></b><span>&nbsp;- Some Federal agencies, many states and some local jurisdictions have adopted statutes, administrative rules and/or ordinances that set out standards regulating the practice of surveying within their jurisdictions. In addition to the standards set forth herein, surveyors shall also conduct their surveys in accordance with all applicable jurisdictional requirements and standards of practice. Where conflicts between the standards set forth herein and any such jurisdictional requirements and standards of practice occur, the more stringent shall apply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>The Normal Standard of Care</span></b><span>&nbsp;- Surveyors should recognize that there may be unwritten local, state, and/or regional standards of care defined by the practice of the ‘prudent surveyor’ in those locales.</span></p>
<p><b><span>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Boundary Resolution</span></b><span>&nbsp;- The boundary lines and corners of any property being surveyed as part of an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey shall be established and/or retraced in accordance with appropriate boundary law principles governed by the set of facts and evidence found in the course of performing the research and survey.</span></p>
<p><b><span>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Measurement Standards&nbsp;</span></b><span>- The following measurement standards address Relative Positional Precision for the monuments or witnesses marking the corners of the surveyed property.</span></p>
<p><b><span>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span>“Relative Positional Precision” means the length of the semi-major axis, expressed in feet or meters, of the error ellipse representing the uncertainty due to random errors in measurements in the location of the monument, or witness, marking any corner of the surveyed property relative to the monument, or witness, marking any other corner of the surveyed property at the 95 percent confidence level (two standard deviations).&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative Positional Precision is estimated by the results of a correctly weighted least squares adjustment of the survey.</span></p>
<p><b><span>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span>Any boundary lines and corners established or retraced may have uncertainties in location resulting from (1) the availability, condition, history and integrity of reference or controlling monuments, (2) ambiguities in the record descriptions or plats of the surveyed property or its adjoiners, (3) occupation or possession lines as they may differ from the written title lines, and (4) Relative Positional Precision. Of these four sources of uncertainty, only Relative Positional Precision is controllable, although due to the inherent errors in any measurement, it cannot be eliminated. The magnitude of the first three uncertainties can be projected based on evidence; Relative Positional Precision is estimated using statistical means (see Section 3.E.i. above and Section 3.E.v. below).</span></p>
<p><b><span>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span>The first three of these sources of uncertainty must be weighed as part of the evidence in the determination of where, in the surveyor’s opinion, the boundary lines and corners of the surveyed property should be located (see Section 3.D. above).&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative Positional Precision is a measure of how precisely the surveyor is able to monument and report those positions; it is not a substitute for the application of proper boundary law principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;A boundary corner or line may have a small Relative Positional Precision because the survey measurements were precise, yet still be in the wrong position (i.e. inaccurate) if it was established or retraced using faulty or improper application of boundary law principles.</span></p>
<p><b><span>iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span>For any measurement technology or procedure used on an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey, the surveyor shall (1) use appropriately trained personnel, (2) compensate for systematic errors, including those associated with instrument calibration, and (3) use appropriate error propagation and measurement design theory (selecting the proper instruments, geometric layouts, and field and computational procedures) to control random errors such that the maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision outlined in Section 3.E.v. below is not exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></b><span>The maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision for an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey is 2 cm (0.07 feet) plus 50 parts per million (based on the direct distance between the two corners being tested).&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognized that in certain circumstances, the size or configuration of the surveyed property, or the relief, vegetation or improvements on the surveyed property will result in survey measurements for which the maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision may be exceeded.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the maximum allowable Relative Positional Precision is exceeded, the surveyor shall note the reason as explained in Section 6.B.ix below.</span></p>
<p><s><span>&nbsp;</span></s></p>
<p><b><span>4.</span></b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Records Research</u></b>&nbsp;- It is recognized that for the performance of an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey, the surveyor will be provided with appropriate data which can be relied upon in the preparation of the survey. The request for an ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey shall set forth the current record description of the property to be surveyed or, in the case of an original survey, the current record description of the parent parcel that contains the property to be surveyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete copies of the most recent title commitment, the current record description of the property to be surveyed (or, in the case of an original survey, the parent parcel), the current record descriptions of adjoiners, any record easements benefiting the property, the record easements or servitudes and covenants burdening the property (all hereinafter referred to collectively as "Record Documents"), documents of record referred to in the Record Documents, documents necessary to ascertain, if possible, the junior/senior relationship pursuant to Section 6.B.vii. below, and any other documents containing desired appropriate information affecting the property being surveyed, and to which the ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey shall make reference, shall be provided to the surveyor for use in conducting the survey. Reference is made to Section 3.B. above.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>5.</span></b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Field Work</u></b>&nbsp;- The Survey shall be performed on the ground (except as otherwise negotiated pursuant to Table A, Item 15 below, if selected by the client), and the field work shall include the following:</span></p>

<p align="left">Below are specifications for a Standard Land Survey by the Texas Society of Professional Surveyors. This type of survey is typically needed for purposes other than a Land Title transaction. This type of survey would be performed for the purpose of building a fence, locating protrusions or&nbsp;intrusions of the subject tract and adjoining tracts of land, locating improvements on the subject tract relative to the boundary or simply locating the subject tract on the ground.&nbsp;This type of survey is performed without the benefit of a Title Insurance policy or commitment. Easements, setback lines and other matters concerning the subject tract may or may not appear on the survey.</p>

Such study and evaluation will culminate in the&nbsp;</span><span>deliberate location or relocation on the ground of the perimeters,</span><span>division lines or boundaries and the determination of area on the&nbsp;</span><span>certain lot, parcel or quantity or real estate. A Standard Land Survey&nbsp;</span><span>is not for title insuring purposes, but is suitable for most any other&nbsp;</span><span>purpose. This survey will not normally locate improvements, rights of&nbsp;</span><span>way or easements within the surveyed site unless requested by the client&nbsp;</span><span>or where such items appear to the surveyor in his professional judgement&nbsp;</span><span>to indicate an encumbrance on the real estate.

<p align="left">6.1.1 Monument material: Material for monuments shall be</p>
<p align="left">chosen in regard to the terrain and situation that exists at</p>
<p align="left">the site of the survey. Consideration should be given to the</p>
<p align="left">following guidelines and the natural erosive forces that will</p>
<p align="left">work against the monument for decades to come.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.1 Wooden stakes should only be used with</p>
<p align="left">discretion.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.2 Iron or steel bars or rods for monuments shall</p>
<p align="left">be a minimum size of 1/2" in diameter by 24" long.</p>
<p align="left">Longer bars or rods should be used in soft soil to</p>
<p align="left">5</p>
<p align="left">insure stability of the monument. Where rocky or caliche</p>
<p align="left">soils prevent specified lengths, the rod should be driven</p>
<p align="left">to refusal at such depths where it will remain stable.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.3 Iron pipes for monuments should be a minimum of</p>
<p align="left">1/2" inside diameter and 24" long. Longer pipes shall be</p>
<p align="left">used in soft soil to insure stability of the monument.</p>
<p align="left">All iron pipes should be sized by the inside diameter.</p>
<p align="left">Where rocky or caliche soils prevent the use of the</p>
<p align="left">specified lengths, the shorter pipe should be driven to</p>
<p align="left">refusal at such depths where it will remain stable.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.4 Non-ferrous metal monuments shall be equal to</p>
<p align="left">requirements for iron rods or iron pipes.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.5 Precast reinforced concrete monuments shall have</p>
<p align="left">a precise station mark such as a center punch or cross</p>
<p align="left">embedded in the cap.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.6 Poured in place concrete monuments shall contain</p>
<p align="left">a precise station mark (as in 6.1.1.5) and be reinforced</p>
<p align="left">with at least 1/4" or larger iron rods or pipe.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.1.7 Other monumentation such as drill holes,</p>
<p align="left">chiselled marks in stone, concrete or steel, punch marks,</p>
<p align="left">precast bronze discs, etc., shall be of sufficient size,</p>
<p align="left">diameter or depth to be definitive, stable, and readily</p>
<p align="left">identified as a survey marker. Objects upon which such</p>
<p align="left">marks or makers are placed shall be of a stable and</p>
<p align="left">permanent nature greater than equal those of iron pipes</p>
<p align="left">or iron rods.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.2 Monument placement: All monuments for corners, for</p>
<p align="left">witness points, points of curve, etc., shall be set vertically</p>
<p align="left">whenever possible and shall be reasonably flush with the earth</p>

<p align="left">noted on the map, plat, or drawing.</p>
<p align="left">6.1.3.4 When possible, monuments shall be referenced</p>
<p align="left">to prominent nearby objects and the information recorded</p>
<p align="left">in the description of the survey. Where permissible and</p>
<p align="left">feasible, witness trees should be marked facing the</p>
<p align="left">corner. Before marking any tree, the surveyor must</p>
<p align="left">consider the probability of his liability for defacing</p>
<p align="left">valuable private property</p>
<b><font face="Courier New" size="2">.<span>&nbsp;</span></font></b><font face="Courier New" size="2">Only healthy witness trees,</font>
<p align="left">a minimum of 6" diameter, breast high (D.B.H.)should be</p>
<p align="left">used. Each witness tree shall be described by species,</p>
<p align="left">diameter, and type of markings.</p>
<p align="left">6.2 Natural or physical monuments: Natural monuments are the</p>
<p align="left">permanent objects which are the works of nature, such as streams,</p>
<p align="left">rivers, ponds, lakes, bays, trees, ledges, rock outcrops and other</p>
<p align="left">definitive terrestrial features.</p>
<p align="left">6.2.1 Tree for corner: A tree standing at a corner may be</p>
<p align="left">marked only when permissible and then shall be marked with</p>
<p align="left">7</p>
<p align="left">care to be reasonably certain of creating only superficial</p>
<p align="left">damage to the tree. Such blazing shall penetrate the bark and</p>
<p align="left">leave an open vertical cut no wider than three inches and no</p>
<p align="left">longer than ten inches. Tree for corner will be marked with</p>
<p align="left">4-way blazes (Blazed on all 4 sides).</p>
<p align="left">6.2.2 Mark boundary line trees only when permission is</p>
<p align="left">received from appropriate authority.</p>
<p align="left">6.2.2.1 Trees on boundary line (line trees) will be</p>
<p align="left">face-blazed with one hack above and one hack below, on</p>
<p align="left">opposite sides of the tree.</p>
<p align="left">6.2.2.2 Trees on each side of the boundary line (within</p>
<p align="left">about three feet)will be hacked with three hacks facing</p>

<p align="left">12.5 The point of beginning of any description shall be carefully</p>
<p align="left">chosen and described so as to distinguish the point from any other</p>
<p align="left">point. Any other point used to locate the point of beginning shall</p>
<p align="left">be known as a "commencing" point.</p>
<p align="left">12.5.1 The point of beginning should be the property corner</p>
<p align="left">that is most easily recognized or found by any interested</p>
<p align="left">parties.</p>

<p align="left">12.5.2 When the new point of beginning is not the same as the</p>
<p align="left">old point of beginning called for in the current and valid</p>
<p align="left">deed, the old point of beginning should be identified or</p>
<p align="left">acknowledged by suitable language when passed or located.</p>
<p align="left">12.5.3 The point of beginning must be located by course and</p>
<p align="left">distance or other locatable methods in relation to established</p>
<p align="left">and recognized record monuments.</p>
<p align="left">12.6 It is recommended, for uniformity, that any metes and bounds</p>
<p align="left">description be written so that the progression of courses is in a</p>
<p align="left">clockwise direction.</p>
<p align="left">12.7 The subsequent written courses in the description shall be</p>
<p align="left">as brief and yet as explanatory as the author can construct.</p>
<p align="left">Brevity shall not cause important locative information to be</p>
<p align="left">omitted and explanatory phrases shall not enlarge the description</p>
<p align="left">to the extent of confusion.</p>
<p align="left">12.8 Curved boundaries shall be identified as tangent or nontangent</p>
<p align="left">curves and sufficient data to locate the curve shall be</p>
<p align="left">recited. In all cases the radius and length of the curve must be</p>
<p align="left">given as well as the general direction the curve takes. Additional</p>
<p align="left">data to assist in locating the curve is desirable, such as bearing</p>
<p align="left">and length of the long chord, central angle, degree of curve by arc</p>
<p align="left">or chord definition, tangent lengths, etc.</p>
<p align="left">12.9 Each metes and bounds description must close and return to</p>
<p align="left">the point of beginning and recite the area enclosed within the</p>
<p align="left">specified tolerances stated in Section 8, herein.</p>
<p align="left">12.10 A statement at the end of the description shall connect</p>
<p align="left">the description to the date of the Standard Land Survey, and the</p>
<p align="left">map or plat representing that survey. Such statement may be</p>
<p align="left">phrased, "This description is based on the Standard Land Survey</p>

<div></div>
<h3>Work Product</h3>
<p>A DTM (Digital Terrain&nbsp;Model)&nbsp;or Topographic Survey requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>A control survey network, with horizontal and vertical positions on primary control points that are monumented, referenced, and placed near or on the project site.</li>
<li>Points of secondary control, which are based upon and supplement primary control to facilitate data acquisition within a project.</li>
<li>A description and location sketch of each control point.</li>
<li>Data acquisition sufficient to generate an accurate DTM for the purpose of generating&nbsp;contours.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>While a topographic map (2 dimensional) may be the typical end product of a topographic survey, for&nbsp;general purposes a processed computer file for a DTM (3 dimensional) is the primary deliverable product. Even when hard copy maps are specified as a part of the deliverable, electronic graphics files (2D and/or 3D) for the final product&nbsp;can&nbsp;be furnished for each project.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<h3><a name="TOC-Conditions"></a>Conditions</h3>
<p>The effect of location, such as rural, suburban, urban, or urban business district, on conditions of a DTM or topographic survey will be minor and will be most dependent upon the purpose of the survey.</p>
<p>The need for appropriate control and tolerances will be the deciding factor when the purpose of the survey is for roadway or ROW design in determining reasonably accurate quantities of construction materials, such as water, spoil, fill, concrete, etc.</p>
<h3><a name="TOC-Field-Procedures"></a>Field Procedures</h3>
<p>DTM or topographic surveys require a reliable horizontal and vertical control system based on acceptably closed and adjusted traverses and level loops. Attention&nbsp;is required&nbsp;be given toward developing this control system before any detail work is begun.</p>
<p>Field work shall be performed to achieve the specified or intended accuracy and results as stated in the manual, in accordance with accepted technical methods, i.e.: TSPS Manual of Practice, and as directed by the manufacturer of the surveying instrument(s) or equipment used.</p>
